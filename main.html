<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
<p>
    Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, representing the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms are characterized by lower time complexity, indicating faster execution, especially as the input grows larger.

<!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
<p>
    Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often denoted by O(f(n)), where 'n' represents the input size. The term <b>Space Complexity</b> is used to describe how the memory requirements of an algorithm scale with the input. Algorithms with lower space complexity are considered more memory-efficient, as they use less space for processing the given input.
